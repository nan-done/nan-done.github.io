I am a first year Master's student at Georgia Tech majoring in Computer Science. Since I'm just starting out my Master's degree after a long corporate break I am interested in a multitude of things which I plan to explore throughout my new academic venture. In general I am interested in Computer Vision for Healthcare, Efficient ML and Systems around ML. I've been working at [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com) (India's largest e-commerce site), in the "demand" division of Hotels. I was fortunate enough to break prod multiple times during my time here, and carry the learnings with me. Here, I got to work on non-trivial problems such as search and autosuggest for a user-facing application. 

I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. For my undergrad thesis I worked with [Prof. Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/) and the [Lichtman Lab](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) @ Harvard. My work focused on improving the throughput of Electron Microscopy by: (1) Automated blur correction i.e selecting an appropriate model to correct blur (2) Better Blur detection; Are the current blur detection metrics aligned with what humans consider "blurry".

I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2026 or co-ops for Fall 2026. Feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like to discuss any opportunities or common interests we have, or most importantly want to see more photos of my cats: "Chandramukhi Chautala" and "Baldev The Destroyer"
